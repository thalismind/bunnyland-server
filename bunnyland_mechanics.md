Below is the first-pass **master mechanics catalogue** for bunnyland. This is intentionally broad. It is not the MVP list. It is the long-term backlog of systems, components, actions, events, services, projections, and plugin classes we may eventually want.

## Current v1 peaceful-pack status

The peaceful starter pack now has playable v1 coverage for the core catalogue loops:

- `lifesim`: hunger, thirst, fatigue, hygiene, comfort, fun, social contact, privacy,
  safety, eat/drink, self-care verbs, sleep fatigue recovery, social recovery through
  speech, affect, homes, claims, careers, business, bills, skills, routines,
  character profiles, whims, home object use/maintenance, invitations, relationships,
  family, pregnancy, birth, adoption, aging stages, and player-facing natural-aging
  policy controls.
- `colonysim`: resources, resource stacks, stockpiles, filters, hauling, reservations,
  ownership, jobs, work priorities, allowed areas, workstation recipes, baking through the
  shared recipe engine, entity outputs for edible/drinkable products, room quality,
  colony wealth/expectations, pawn profiles, passions/backstories, job bills, prisoners
  and recruitment, research/tech unlocks, incidents, trade offers, caravans, diplomacy,
  body-part health, surgery/prosthetics, wound tending, medicine uses, rescue to medical
  bed, bed rest, infection progress, and mental breaks/inspirations.
- `gardensim`: soil, tilling, planting, watering, fertilizer, growth, seasonal withering,
  greenhouse exceptions, crop quality, regrowth, pests, weeding, inspection,
  edible/resource harvests, tree tapping and sap, processing machines with cancel/repair
  and breakdown state, farm animals, feeding, petting, breeding, animal products, fishing,
  mining, mine levels, ladders, geodes, foraging, gifts/friendship, mail, quests,
  festivals, bundles, shipping, collections, museum donation, rewards, and daily farm
  reset.

The remaining catalogue text is still broader than v1 outside these implemented peaceful
starter-pack surfaces. Treat unimplemented headings below as backlog unless a component,
handler, consequence/system, event, prompt fragment, and test exists in
`src/bunnyland/mechanics/` and `tests/`.

The design target is not to clone any one game. The target is to extract the loops that make those games sticky: needs, relationships, work, scarcity, seasons, growth, danger, exploration, memory, and the joy of small systems colliding.

The inspirations break down cleanly:

| Inspiration    | bunnyland package | Core fantasy                                                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The Sims       | `life-sim`        | characters have needs, moods, relationships, homes, routines, families, memories    |
| RimWorld       | `colony-sim`      | characters organize work, survive incidents, build settlements, spiral emotionally  |
| Conan Exiles   | `barbarian-sim`   | harsh survival, weather, combat, crafting, thralls, bases, raids                    |
| Stardew Valley | `garden-sim`      | seasons, crops, animals, gifts, villagers, festivals, cozy production chains        |
| Skyrim         | `dragon-sim`      | open-world exploration, quests, factions, skills-by-use, dungeons, dragons, shouts  |
| Daggerfall     | `dagger-sim`      | procedural realm expands through rumors, guilds, banks, law, travel, and dungeons   |
| FTL            | `void-sim`        | crews survive ships, stations, planets, alien contact, tech, contracts, and hazards |
| Fallout        | `nuke-sim`        | wasteland survival, radiation, mutation, scavenging, settlement salvage, jury-rigged crafting |
| Deus Ex / Watch Dogs / Cyberpunk 2077 | `neon-sim` | hackers, surveillance, street economies, corporate intrigue, cybernetics, reputation |
| Jurassic Park / ARK / Dino Crisis | `dino-sim` | fossil and species identification, cloning, egg handling, reptile procreation, hatching, and kaiju storyteller incidents |
| Dwarf Fortress | `fortress-sim`    | deep settlement simulation, materials, history, disasters, artifacts, absurd detail |

For source grounding: The Sims uses traits, emotions, whims, aspirations, skills, careers, crafting hobbies, and life-state systems; RimWorld centers on colonist moods, needs, wounds, illnesses, addictions, social bonds, storyteller incidents, work priorities, and mental breaks; Conan Exiles emphasizes survival, building, thralls, weather, temperature, hunger/thirst, PvP/siege, mounts, pets, purges, and world bosses; Stardew Valley revolves around seasonal crops, fertilizer, skills, villagers, gifts, friendship, farming, fishing, mining, and festivals; Skyrim’s replay loop is open-world exploration, factions, skills, combat, magic, stealth, followers, crafting, dragons, and shouts; Daggerfall contributes procedural scale, guilds, banks, services, law, travel, generated quests, and generated dungeons; FTL contributes crewed-ship pressure, subsystem damage, sector travel, distress signals, resource scarcity, and cascading emergencies; Dwarf Fortress goes deeper than all of these with generated worlds, histories, fortress management, geology, migrants, nobles, justice, strange moods, artifacts, tantrum spirals, and many more systems; Deus Ex, Watch Dogs, and Cyberpunk 2077 contribute cyberpunk infiltration, hacking, surveillance, corporate power, street economies, cybernetics, and reputation pressure; Jurassic Park, ARK, and Dino Crisis contribute dangerous animals, eggs, taming, escapes, containment failure, and monster-scale emergency response.

# 1. Shared engine mechanics

These are not tied to any one game package. Every plugin builds on them.

## 1.1 Entity identity and description

### Mechanics

Every meaningful thing in the world is an entity:

```text
character
room
item
container
building
job
memory
note
faction
quest
spell
crop
animal
workstation
resource node
event source
controller
generator
```

### Components

```python
IdentityComponent
DescriptionComponent
TagComponent
LifecycleComponent
PersistenceComponent
GeneratedContentComponent
```

### Systems and services

```text
EntityNamingService
DescriptionRenderService
TagQueryService
LifecycleSystem
PersistenceProjection
GeneratedContentValidationService
```

### Events

```text
EntityCreatedEvent
EntityDestroyedEvent
EntityRenamedEvent
DescriptionChangedEvent
TagsChangedEvent
```

---

## 1.2 Physical containment and spatial graph

### Mechanics

Canonical physical state uses `Contains`.

```text
room contains character
room contains chest
chest contains apple
character contains sword
character holding sword
character wearing cloak
```

Rooms form a graph through exits.

### Edges

```python
Contains
ExitTo
Holding
Wearing
Owns
ReservedBy
```

### Components

```python
PhysicalComponent
WeightComponent
ContainerComponent
InventoryComponent
PortableComponent
InteractiveComponent
HoldableComponent
WearableComponent
DroppableComponent
```

### Systems and services

```text
ContainmentIntegritySystem
ContainmentQueryService
ReachabilityService
InventoryCapacitySystem
EquipmentIntegritySystem
OwnershipPolicySystem
ReservationSystem
RoomGraphService
PathfindingService
```

### Actions

```text
take
drop
put
hold
unhold
wear
remove
inspect
look
open
close
lock
unlock
```

### Events

```text
EntityContainedEvent
EntityRemovedFromContainerEvent
ItemTakenEvent
ItemDroppedEvent
ItemPutEvent
ItemHeldEvent
ItemWornEvent
ContainerOpenedEvent
ContainerClosedEvent
OwnershipChangedEvent
ReservationCreatedEvent
ReservationExpiredEvent
```

---

## 1.3 Time, tick, calendar, and scheduling

### Mechanics

The game is asynchronous and real-time-ish, not fixed-turn. Characters regenerate points over real time. Simulation systems run before queued character commands.

### Components

```python
WorldClockComponent
CalendarComponent
TimeOfDayComponent
SeasonComponent
ScheduleComponent
CooldownComponent
InitiativeComponent
```

### Systems

```text
WorldClockSystem
CalendarSystem
TimeOfDaySystem
SeasonSystem
CooldownSystem
ScheduleSystem
InitiativeOrderingSystem
```

### Rules

```text
Simulation systems run before characters act.
Characters with executable queued commands act by InitiativeComponent.score.
Ties are randomized each tick.
One world-lane command per character per tick for MVP.
Focus-lane commands may run before that character’s world command.
```

### Events

```text
TickStartedEvent
TickCompletedEvent
DayChangedEvent
SeasonChangedEvent
ScheduleChangedEvent
CooldownExpiredEvent
InitiativeRolledEvent
```

---

## 1.4 Action and Focus points

### Mechanics

Two regenerated resources:

```text
Action = world-facing effort
Focus = private mental effort / memory / note / dialogue concentration
```

Both regenerate in real time for every character, regardless of controller. Suspended characters still regenerate but do not spend.

### Components

```python
ActionPointsComponent
FocusPointsComponent
PointRegenModifierComponent
PointOverflowModifierComponent
```

### Systems

```text
ActionPointRegenSystem
FocusPointRegenSystem
PointModifierSystem
PointOverflowSystem
```

### Command costs

```python
CommandCost(action=0, focus=0)
```

Examples:

```text
move: Action 1
take: Action 1
eat/drink: Action 1
say/tell: Action 1 + Focus 1
take note: Focus 1
remember/search notes: Focus 1
write on physical object: Action 1 + Focus 1
```

### Events

```text
ActionPointsChangedEvent
FocusPointsChangedEvent
PointRegenModifiedEvent
PointSpentEvent
PointOverflowGrantedEvent
```

---

## 1.5 Volatile command queues

### Mechanics

Players and LLMs can submit commands at any time.

If affordable and valid, the command runs on the next tick. If not affordable, the submitter can choose to queue or deny. Queued commands do not survive restart.

### Runtime classes

```python
QueuedCommand
CommandCost
CommandQueue
CommandLane
CommandExecutionResult
CommandValidator
CommandDispatcher
```

### Lanes

```text
Focus lane:
  take note
  remember/search
  private reflection tools

World lane:
  move
  take
  drop
  put
  use
  eat
  drink
  say
  tell
  write
  sleep
  wake
  fight
  craft
```

### Systems and services

```text
CommandIngestService
CommandQueueService
CommandValidationService
CommandExecutionService
CommandExpirationService
ControllerGenerationValidator
```

### Events

```text
CommandSubmittedEvent
CommandQueuedEvent
CommandDeniedEvent
CommandAcceptedEvent
CommandRejectedEvent
CommandExpiredEvent
CommandExecutedEvent
CommandCancelledEvent
```

---

## 1.6 Controllers

### Mechanics

Characters persist. Controllers are replaceable.

Controllers:

```text
Discord human controller
LLM agent controller
Suspended/no-op controller
```

### Components

```python
DiscordControllerComponent
LLMControllerComponent
SuspendedControllerComponent
SuspendedComponent
ControlPolicyComponent
```

### Edges

```python
ControlledBy
DefaultController
```

### Systems and services

```text
ControllerRegistry
ControllerHandoffService
ControllerGenerationService
DiscordControllerProvider
LLMControllerProvider
SuspendedControllerProvider
ControllerPromptDispatchService
```

### Rules

```text
Every controller change increments generation.
Stale commands are rejected.
Suspended controller submits no commands.
Suspended characters are ignored by most harmful systems.
Suspended characters regenerate Action and Focus.
```

### Events

```text
ControllerChangedEvent
CharacterTakenOverEvent
CharacterReleasedToLLMEvent
CharacterSuspendedEvent
CharacterResumedEvent
StaleControllerCommandRejectedEvent
```

---

## 1.7 Prompt generation

### Mechanics

Humans and LLM agents receive the same foundation prompt.

Prompt sections:

```text
who you are
where you are
what you can see
what you are holding/wearing/carrying
what you feel
recent context
private notes/memory recall
available actions
Action/Focus points
important boundaries/policies
```

### Components

```python
PromptProfileComponent
PromptDirtyComponent
RecentContextComponent
MemoryProfileComponent
RoomSummaryComponent
```

### Services and projections

```text
PromptContextBuilder
PromptPartRegistry
PromptRenderer
RoomSummaryProjection
InventoryPromptPart
NeedPromptPart
AffectPromptPart
MemoryPromptPart
ActionPromptPart
PolicyPromptPart
```

### Events

```text
PromptContextBuiltEvent
PromptRenderedEvent
PromptDeliveredEvent
PromptDirtyEvent
PromptFailedEvent
```

---

## 1.8 Typed events and event bus

### Mechanics

Events are typed models, not arbitrary blobs. They drive projections, memory, notifications, LLM context, and debugging.

### Base classes

```python
DomainEvent
EventVisibility
EventBus
EventHandler
EventProjection
```

### Visibility

```text
PUBLIC
ROOM
DIRECTED
PRIVATE
SYSTEM
```

### Common events

```text
ActorMovedEvent
SpeechSaidEvent
SpeechToldEvent
ItemTakenEvent
FoodEatenEvent
DrinkConsumedEvent
NeedChangedEvent
ThoughtCreatedEvent
AffectChangedEvent
NoteTakenEvent
MemoryWrittenEvent
RoomSummaryInvalidatedEvent
```

### Services

```text
TypedEventBus
EventPersistenceService
EventVisibilityService
EventReplayService
EventSubscriptionRegistry
```

---

## 1.9 Plugins and extension units

A plugin is a loadable extension bundle. A mechanic is only one possible thing a plugin can provide.

### Plugin contribution types

```text
ECS components
ECS edges
ECS systems
commands
actions
typed events
controllers
generators
integrations
projections
prompt parts
policy tags
world defaults
configuration schemas
```

### Classes

```python
Plugin

# 6. `dragonsim` package — Skyrim-inspired mechanics

Skyrim’s replayability comes from wandering, discovering locations, joining factions, following questlines, building skills by use, collecting loot, crafting, stealth, magic, followers, ancient beasts, voice powers, books/lore, and repeatable adventure quests. Bunnyland should keep those broad loops while using its own presentation: voice phrases can be written, painted, or carved on ordinary writable/carvable world objects instead of depending on a special fixed monument type.

# 7. `daggersim` package — Daggerfall-inspired procedural RPG mechanics

`daggersim` is the procedural RPG expansion package. It builds on the generic
DM/worldgen infrastructure to support ongoing world expansion through rumors, travel,
procedural quests, institutions, settlements, dungeons, services, guilds, temples, banks,
laws, courts, property, class-making, spell-making, reputation, and supernatural
afflictions. Where `worldgen` creates validated content, `daggersim` defines why and when
that content should be created as part of gameplay.

The key boundary is:

```text
worldgen / DM system = generic content generation infrastructure
daggersim = procedural realm gameplay built on top of that infrastructure
```

## 7.1 Expandable world frontiers

### Mechanics

Not every town, dungeon, road, bank, or guildhall needs to exist in full ECS detail
immediately. `daggersim` introduces unrealized content: stubs that become full ECS content
when rumors, quests, travel, factions, incidents, or services need them.

```text
rumor
need for content
generated proposal
validation
ECS instantiation
quest/service/reputation hooks
player action
events and consequences
```

### Components

```python
ProceduralSiteComponent
UnrealizedLocationComponent
ExpansionHookComponent
```

### Systems and projections

```text
ExpansionNeedSystem
ProceduralSiteInstantiationSystem
GeneratedContentValidationSystem
WorldExpansionProjection
```

### Events

```text
ExpansionRequestedEvent
GeneratedContentProposedEvent
GeneratedContentValidatedEvent
GeneratedSiteInstantiatedEvent
GeneratedSiteRejectedEvent
```

## 7.2 Regions and settlements

### Mechanics

`daggersim` defines the civic map above the room graph:

```text
realm
region
province
city
town
village
hamlet
district
neighborhood
institution
road
wilderness route
```

### Components

```python
RealmComponent
RegionComponent
SettlementComponent
SettlementDistrictComponent
RoadNodeComponent
TravelHubComponent
CivicInstitutionComponent
ServiceDirectoryComponent
```

### Systems and generators

```text
RegionGenerator
SettlementGenerator
DistrictGenerator
RoadNetworkGenerator
ServiceDirectorySystem
SettlementExpansionSystem
```

### Actions

```text
ask directions
ask about services
travel to settlement
visit district
look for work
ask about rumors
```

## 7.3 Rumors as expansion seeds

### Mechanics

Rumors can be real, false, outdated, exaggerated, or generated into truth later. They are
asynchronous handles for unrealized content.

### Components

```python
RumorComponent
RumorSourceComponent
RumorReliabilityComponent
RumorTargetComponent
```

### Systems

```text
RumorGenerationSystem
RumorSpreadSystem
RumorValidationSystem
RumorToQuestSystem
RumorToSiteExpansionSystem
```

### Actions

```text
ask for rumors
spread rumor
investigate rumor
take note about rumor
verify rumor
```

### Events

```text
RumorCreatedEvent
RumorHeardEvent
RumorSpreadEvent
RumorVerifiedEvent
RumorDisprovenEvent
RumorBecameQuestEvent
```

## 7.4 Procedural quests

### Mechanics

Procedural quests are the main loop that turns the world into a generator of obligations.
They may require generated settlements, NPCs, dungeons, services, items, or routes.

```text
delivery
escort
retrieval
dungeon crawl
find person
rescue
debt collection
curse cure
monster hunt
investigation
legal errand
guild errand
pilgrimage
reputation repair
property dispute
lost heirloom
map fragment
```

Timed quests are allowed to fail. Failure should matter through reputation loss, rank
delay, legal trouble, relationship damage, debt, new rumors, rivals, or follow-up quests.

### Components

```python
QuestTemplateComponent
GeneratedQuestComponent

## 7.16 How `daggersim` uses worldgen

```text
daggersim does not own all generation.
daggersim owns procedural RPG reasons for generation.
worldgen owns content creation.
core owns validation and instantiation.
```

Example flows:

```text
guild work -> quest template -> dungeon expansion request -> worldgen proposal -> validation -> generated dungeon objective
rumor -> unrealized hamlet -> travel -> settlement expansion -> service directory update -> usable healer
loan default -> debt collector request -> generated collector NPC and route -> later dialogue/action consequences
```

# 8. `voidsim` package — FTL-inspired sci-fi frontier mechanics

`void-sim` is the sci-fi frontier package. The internal package name should be `voidsim`,
matching the existing no-hyphen Python package style while the public-facing package label
uses the same hyphenated style as `life-sim`, `dragon-sim`, and `dagger-sim`.

Its main inspiration is **FTL**: crews under pressure, ship systems taking damage,
scarce fuel and supplies, sector travel, distress signals, boarding, hazards, and
emergencies that cascade across small systems. The package broadens that into bunnyland's
science-fiction layer: ships, stations, planets, alien contact, tech systems, hazards,
contracts, salvage, and exploration without turning the core engine into a space game.

## 8.8 How `voidsim` uses worldgen

`voidsim` should use the same expansion pattern as `dagger-sim`, but with space frontiers
instead of civic fantasy frontiers.

```text

survey contract -> generated planet site -> alien ecology -> sample quarantine -> research unlock
ship mortgage default -> creditor faction pressure -> bounty/impound event -> legal or underworld choices
```

# 9. `nukesim` package — Fallout-inspired wasteland mechanics

`nuke-sim` is the post-disaster wasteland package. The internal package name should be
`nukesim`, matching the existing no-hyphen Python package style while the public-facing
package label uses the same hyphenated style as `void-sim`, `garden-sim`, and
`dragon-sim`.

Its main inspiration is **Fallout**: contaminated ruins, radiation pressure, strange
mutations, scavenged junk, jury-rigged gear, settlement survival, faction salvage rights,
and dangerous old-world technology. The package should not make bunnyland a combat-only
RPG. It should add environmental risk and resourceful crafting loops that interact with
colony work, void-sim radiation shields, barbarian-sim survival pressure, and storyteller
incidents.

## 9.1 Radiation exposure and protection

### Mechanics

```text
radiation source
fallout zone
hotspot
contaminated water
irradiated food

```

### Components

```python

## 9.2 Mutation pressure and outcomes

### Mechanics

```text
mutation pressure
mutation threshold
beneficial mutation
harmful mutation
unstable mutation
mutation resistance
mutation suppressant
adapted creature
feral transformation
```

### Components

```python
MutationComponent

ChaosMutationPressureComponent
CyberneticMutationPressureComponent
```

### Systems

```text

stabilize mutation
suppress mutation
study mutation
harvest mutant sample
```

### Events

```text
MutationPressureChangedEvent
MutationManifestedEvent
MutationStabilizedEvent
MutationSuppressedEvent

```

Mutation pressure must stay source-specific. Radiation, chaos, and cybernetic pressure may
interact later, but each keeps its own component so packages can be enabled independently.

## 9.3 Wasteland scavenging and salvage

### Mechanics

```text
scavenging site
ruin cache
locked crate
hazardous salvage

## 9.4 Jury-rigged crafting, repair, and chems

### Mechanics

```text

purified water
scrap recipe
field repair
```

### Components

```python

```

### Events

```text
WastelandItemCraftedEvent
ModInstalledEvent
FieldRepairCompletedEvent

```

`nukesim` should reuse `colonysim` resource stacks, recipes, and workstations where they
fit. It should add new components only when the wasteland rule is distinct: radiation,
mutation, hazardous salvage, chems, and jury-rigged instability.

## 9.5 Settlements, factions, and old-world tech

### Mechanics

```text
settlement claim
scrap barricade
water purifier
generator
radio beacon
trader route
raider pressure
faction reputation
old-world terminal
reactor core
vault door
```

### Components

```python

boot old-world terminal
```

### Events

```text
SettlementClaimedEvent
PurifierBuiltEvent
GeneratorPoweredEvent
BeaconActivatedEvent
TraderRouteOpenedEvent
FactionSalvageNegotiatedEvent
OldWorldTerminalBootedEvent
```

## 9.6 How `nukesim` uses worldgen

`nukesim` should expand worlds through hazardous sites and salvage leads:

```text
geiger spike -> generated ruin -> radiation source -> scavenging cache -> mutation pressure
radio beacon -> generated settlement -> purifier job -> trader route -> raider incident
pre-war keycard -> generated vault door -> old-world terminal -> faction salvage dispute
```

The first playable slice should be small and deterministic: radiation accumulation,
shielding, decontamination, mutation manifestation, one scavenging action, and recipes that
use found scrap.

---

# 10. `neonsim` package — Deus Ex / Watch Dogs / Cyberpunk 2077-inspired cyberpunk mechanics

`neon-sim` is the cyberpunk city package. The internal package name should be `neonsim`,
matching the existing no-hyphen Python package style while the public-facing package label
uses the same hyphenated style as `void-sim`, `dragon-sim`, and `dagger-sim`.

Its main inspirations are **Deus Ex**, **Watch Dogs**, and **Cyberpunk 2077**: corporate
systems, surveillance, street-level access, hacking as actionable interaction with devices,
consequences for being seen, cybernetics, fixers, gangs, and missions that can be solved
through infiltration, social pressure, economics, violence, or data. The tone should land
near Blade Runner and Cyberpunk 2077: rain, debt, neon, corporate shadow power, dangerous
bargains, and people trying to survive inside systems that record everything.

The first implementation should keep hacking in ECS actions and consequences. Minigames
can exist later as client-side or script-driven presentation over the same actions.

tradeoff: money, maintenance, heat, health, identity exposure, legality, power use, social
stigma, or vulnerability to hacking.

## 10.7 How `neonsim` uses other packages

`neonsim` should compose heavily with existing systems rather than becoming a second core.

```text
dagger-sim law/reputation -> cyberpunk warrants, institutions, services, debt, and bounties
void-sim tech/hacking -> terminals, drones, data salvage, and cybernetics
colonysim jobs/reservations -> crew work, safehouse logistics, crafting, and black-market production
lifesim relationships -> contacts, jealousy, blackmail, favors, household risk, and private memory
barbariansim combat/policy -> street fights, raids, PvP boundaries, and weapon legality
```

`neonsim` should use worldgen for city expansion:

```text
fixer rumor -> generated corp site -> access challenge -> surveillance/evidence -> payout/reputation/heat
black-market lead -> generated vendor -> contraband offer -> warrant risk -> debt/favor consequences
data leak -> generated shell company -> terminal network -> blackmail file -> faction reaction
```

# 11. `dinosim` package — Jurassic Park / ARK / Dino Crisis-inspired creature lifecycle

`dino-sim` is the prehistoric creature lifecycle package. The internal package name should
be `dinosim`, matching the existing no-hyphen Python package style while the public-facing
package label uses the same hyphenated style as `garden-sim`, `void-sim`, and `neon-sim`.

Its main inspirations are **Jurassic Park**, **ARK**, and **Dino Crisis**: fossils, eggs,
taming, training, caretaking, tracking, dangerous escapes, and the moment when a managed
animal becomes an emergency. This is not a park-management package and should not introduce
Zoo Tycoon-style guest attraction, ticketing, visitor happiness, shops, tours, or exhibit
rating loops. It is survival farming with pulp battles: Jurassic Park with a hint of
Pacific Rim, where creatures can be livestock, companions, or enemies depending on species,
training, hunger, enclosure state, and recent events.

The initial package should focus on three primary mechanics:

```text
egg handling and reptile procreation
kaiju attack storyteller incidents
fossil and species identification and cloning
```

Everything else in this section supports those loops. Taming, training, containment,
feeding, and creature products are useful once creatures exist, but they should not
displace the lifecycle, discovery, or incident systems as the package's core. Full genetic
engineering should be left out at first. The initial cloning surface should be constrained
to recovering viable ancient material, identifying it, preparing a clone candidate, and
producing an egg or embryo that the normal incubation and lifesim ageing surface can take
over.

## 11.1 Fossils, identification, and cloning

### Mechanics

```text
fossil deposit
excavation site
fossil fragment
bone set
amber sample
ancient tissue
sample contamination
species identification
genome completeness
clone viability

embryo
lab incubator
surrogate egg

GenomeCompletenessComponent
CloneViabilityComponent
CloneCandidateComponent

```

### Systems

```text
FossilDiscoverySystem
ExcavationSystem
FossilIdentificationSystem
AncientSampleSystem
ContaminationSystem
GenomeCompletenessSystem
CloneViabilitySystem
ClonePreparationSystem
LabIncubationSystem
SurrogateEggSystem
```

### Actions

```text

prepare clone
implant embryo
monitor lab incubator
discard failed clone
```

### Events

```text

FossilCleanedEvent
SpeciesIdentifiedEvent
AncientSampleExtractedEvent
SampleContaminatedEvent
SampleStabilizedEvent
ClonePreparedEvent
EmbryoImplantedEvent
LabIncubationChangedEvent
CloneFailedEvent
SurrogateEggCreatedEvent
```

Cloning should feed into the egg and hatching systems instead of bypassing them. A
successful clone preparation creates either an `EmbryoComponent` in a `LabIncubatorComponent`
or a `SurrogateEggComponent` that also carries the normal egg/incubation components. Once a
clone hatches, `dinosim` should hand the creature to the lifesim-compatible ageing surface
as a hatchling or juvenile rather than owning a separate adulthood timeline.

```

Eggs are the common output of natural procreation and cloning. A naturally laid egg should
carry parentage and species data; a cloned egg should carry source sample and species
identification data. After hatching, the creature should become a normal character or
critter entity with lifesim-compatible age state so ageing, care, relationships, injury,
and death do not need a separate dinosaur-only timeline.

```

Kaiju attacks should be storyteller incidents when both `dinosim` and `colonysim` are
enabled. Colony-sim provides the settlement target, jobs, reservations, hauling, repair
work, and post-attack recovery pressure; without colony-sim, kaiju can remain local
encounters or generated threats, but should not assume settlement damage or colony job
queues exist.

The incident should be selected by the storyteller budget, create an active incident entity,
and then spawn or reference a kaiju threat. Resolution should use normal incident handling
plus concrete colony work when available: evacuate, fight or drive off the kaiju, repair
damaged settlement objects, haul debris, and treat casualties. This makes kaiju attacks a
colony-scale emergency without adding park guests or attraction management.

## 11.8 How `dinosim` uses other packages

`dinosim` should build on the existing survival and farming surface without turning into a
theme-park management game.

```text
garden-sim crops/seasons -> feed production, nesting conditions, forage, and ranch labor
barbarian-sim combat/survival -> dangerous encounters, armor, weapons, downing, and recovery
colonysim jobs/reservations -> enclosure repair, feeding jobs, resource hauling, and assigned handlers
lifesim relationships -> trust, imprinting, companion bonds, household risk, and grief after losses
storyteller incidents -> escapes, apex predators, kaiju arrivals, stampedes, and containment failures
void-sim emergency logic -> alarms, evacuation, quarantine pens, and system-like containment protocols
```

`dinosim` should use worldgen for dangerous creature discovery:

```text
strange tracks -> generated nesting site -> egg/clutch -> parent threat -> ranching or survival consequence
fossil rumor -> generated dig site -> identified fossil -> viable clone sample -> lab egg/embryo
storm damage -> enclosure breach -> escaped creature -> tracking/taming/battle -> settlement aftermath
legend rumor + colonysim settlement -> generated apex lair -> kaiju incident -> army response -> repair jobs
```

# 12. `fortresssim` package — Dwarf Fortress-inspired mechanics

Dwarf Fortress is the “mother of all sims” here, but it is intentionally not practical to exhaustively scope. The useful direction for bunnyland is to borrow *depth patterns*: generated world history, materials, geology, settlement logistics, strange moods, artifacts, nobles, justice, taverns, libraries, hospitals, sieges, migrants, trade caravans, tantrum spirals, and the fact that the world continues beyond any one character. Dwarf Fortress includes generated worlds and histories, fortress mode, adventure mode, legends mode, geology, z-level digging, farming, migrants, caravans, nobles, mandates, justice, vampires, strange moods, artifacts, and fortress-ending spirals.

# 16. The most important design warning

The dangerous failure mode is trying to make one giant `SimulationSystem`.

Do not.

The design should stay plugin-shaped:

```text
hunger owns hunger
thirst owns thirst
sleep owns sleep
crops own crop growth
weather owns weather
combat owns combat
jobs own jobs
memory owns memory
```

Systems may read broadly but write narrowly.

Good:

```text
ThirstSystem reads TemperatureComponent.
ThirstSystem writes ThirstComponent.
ThirstSystem emits ThirstChangedEvent.
```

Bad:

```text
TemperatureSystem directly mutates thirst, mood, health, prompts, death, and social behavior.
```

Emergence comes from event-driven interaction among small systems, not from one giant god-object.

This mechanics catalogue is enough to start turning bunnyland into a real backlog: every package can now be split into `components.py`, `systems.py`, `actions.py`, `events.py`, `prompt.py`, `policy.py`, and `tests/`.
